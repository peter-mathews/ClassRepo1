So far, I have had a good experience with Git. I have used Git before for my technical
projects as well as to organize my coursework in private repositories. I like using Git
because it's straightforward and has good integration through the command line as well 
as most IDE's/Glorified Text Editors (cough VS Code). I keep all my repositories within
my Github account, although I've used Gitlab for its Continuous Integration pipeline
as well as Dr. Gheith's CS429/CS439 Git server. 

One of the interesting things I"ve noticed seeing other people learn the Git process
is the confusion between what Git is versus the providers like Github or Gitlab. Having
exposure to multiple sites has helped me separate Git from Github and whatnot. Also, I
pretty much knew my knowledge of Git is pretty much just a working knowledge very specific
to my workflow so far. From a conceptual and theoretical point I really don't have enough
knowledge to be able to deliver a lecture like this one. I just solve my issues through
googling, and fortunately Git is common enough such that someone else on StackOverflow
would have ran into my same issue.
