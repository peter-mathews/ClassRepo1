On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        krl_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

This is the output of "git status" after fetching, adding, committing, and pushing the two files
on step 4. "On branch master" means that I am on the main branch of the repository. I am up to
date with the remote repository's main branch, listed as "origin/master" which was verified
by fetch and the previous merge commit. My noadd file is untracked, meaning it is not present in
the remote repository. If I wanted to track it, I would use "git add krl_noadd.txt" or "git add ."
which is suggested by the command. I prefer not to have untracked files be present in git status
so I would add the file to the .gitignore normally, or put specifically-untracked files into
their own directory within my local repository.
