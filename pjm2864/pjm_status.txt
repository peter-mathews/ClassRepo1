Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        pjm_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

The first line means that the local master branch that I have on my local repository
is up to date. Meaning, all the files in the remote repository in the master branch is 
in my local repository. However, the git status command does present an issue to me.
There is an untracked file called pjm_noadd.txt. This file just has not been added
to stage my file. Meaning, it is in my local directory but not in the staging process 
and not in my local repository either. I should use the git add command to fix this.
In the very last line of the git status message, it essentially says the same thing but
also mentions there is nothing to commit. This is because no files have been staged yet,
so there is nothing even ready to commit.
