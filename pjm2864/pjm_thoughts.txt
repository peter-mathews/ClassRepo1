My experience with Github has been a mostly positive experience. However, 
my first time trying to push a text file from my local repository the remote
repository was an arudous task. This hurdle was simply because I forgot to 
address the git pull issue. Although seemingly insignificant, it is an
indispensable tool used to update my local repository with the new files from
the remote repository. I have never used git before, so I will definitely learn
to be patient with it and all its odd obstacles that must be overcome.

Another obstacle I encountered was a text editor issue. As I used the git commit 
command, the shell opened up a vim editor so that I may insert a message along
with my submission. I have never used the vim editor and have always been an emacs user.
I had no idea how to navigate it, much less how to insert my own text 
and then submit that as information for git to use. So, in the future I will
definitely be using the git commit -m command where I can insert the text in
the command line itself without having to even rely on an editor. Overall, I like git and
its ability to upload a file I'm using in my local shell and upload that to
a remote repository. Seeing my file pop up in my browser was very satisfying!
