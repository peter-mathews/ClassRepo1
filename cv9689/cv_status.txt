Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        cv_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

The first line indicates my local branch is up to date with the origin/master
branch. The untracked file shows what has yet to be commited from the local
branch to the master branch.
