Thoughts on git?

I've used it plenty of times. I have used it for programming and engineering projects.
I also use it for work. My experience with it so far has been nothing but good.
It helps facilitate and ease the implementation of software based projects by letting you 
keep source code in repositories. One of the things that I've realized it to always use
git pull before comitting changes that way you commit only your changes. Sometimes there
can be merge conflicts and it cause loss of progress, this has been one of the problems I've 
faced then working on projects.
